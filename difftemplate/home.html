            <h2>Our idea</h2>
        <p><br><br>An integral component to public safety is reliable and effective emergency safety system. The most common type of public emergency safety system installed in every 
            commercial and private building is, of course, a fire alarm system. We wanted to iterate on the concept of a simple fire alarm system and see if we could make it "smart", and 
            this led us to exploring the idea of other kinds of "smart" security and alarm systems, primarily ones focuses on natural hazard detection and alerting (i.e. fire, water, air).
            We decided to focus on fire since it is one of the more common & dangerous emergencies that occurs inside buildings. We wanted to create something meant to supplement current fire 
            safety infrastructure already installed, but not replace it.<br><br>

            <h2>The Breezy</h2>
            <p>
                Our idea for our flagship product is called the Breezy. It is a smart fire alarm system powered by raspberry pi microcontrollers and some sensors.
                We made a small scale model to demonstrate the concept. Essentially, we connect smoke sensors to the Raspberry Pi and install them in each hallway of
                of building. The the Raspberry Pi collects data and will trigger an alarm when sensors meet a certain threshold. In application, the Pi's can also be 
                rigged up to a sprinkler system, and the Pi could also send sensor data to a server and distribute it accordingly to first responders.
